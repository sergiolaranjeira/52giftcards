Here are all files of the article I wrote on medium:
https://medium.com/@serlaranjeira/my-gift-to-the-world-d3d6bdbd93fd

All Editable files are available here and also the final images.

All these files you can download and use them as you want.

If you want me to add more cards please add the sentence on this google doc:

All the images are also free. I based my search on flickr and on this post on medium:
https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b

Most of the images came from:
http://www.gratisography.com/
https://unsplash.com/
https://www.flickr.com/

I've also used an action on Photoshop to give the same look to all images (a retro style like instagram)

I want to thank to all artists and to all these amazing people for making these project possible.

Once again, all of this is for free and editable.

Use it and abuse it.
